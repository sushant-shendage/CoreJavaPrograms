/**
 * üöÄ Final Verdict:
 * 
 * 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Anonymous Inner Classes** are unnamed classes that either **extend a class** or **implement an interface**.
 * 2Ô∏è‚É£ They allow for **inline implementation** of an interface or class.
 * 3Ô∏è‚É£ They **cannot have explicit constructors** because they lack a name.
 * 4Ô∏è‚É£ Typically used for **event handling**, **short-lived implementations**, or **one-time use cases**.
 * 5Ô∏è‚É£ Helps **reduce boilerplate code** when a separate implementation class is unnecessary.
 * 
 * ‚úÖ This is the correct and complete conclusion for Anonymous Inner Classes in Java! üéØ
