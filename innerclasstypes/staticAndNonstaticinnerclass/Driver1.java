 * âœ… A **static inner class** can contain both static and non-static members.

 * âœ… Static methods inside a **static inner class** can be accessed directly using the class name.
 * âœ… Non-static methods inside a **static inner class** require an instance of the inner class.
 * âœ… A **non-static inner class** requires an instance of the outer class to be instantiated.
