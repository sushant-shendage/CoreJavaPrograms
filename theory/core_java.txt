What is Computer?
Computer is an electronic device which is composed of software and hardware components. Primarily used to store, process and retrive data

Examples of software components consist of 
Os,VM,device drivers,firmwares,programing softwares, middlewares
Examples of hardware components consist of
Processing units, input device,output device

==================================================================
What are hardware ?
Set of electronic components on which applications runs are known as hardware
E.g::CPU,GPU,SSD,HDD
==================================================================
what is software?
Set of programs which works in co-ordination with each other to perform a specific task In order to solve real world problem are together known as software
E.g:power point presentation,excel,Pubg etc
==================================================================
Programing language:

Language :
Language is medium of communication 

Programing language:
Programing languagea are the languages used to communicate with Computer 

Technically we can say that,
The languages by using which we command or provide instructions to the computer in order to perform task from computer is known as Programing language
________________________________________________________________________________
Types of Programing languages:
LLL:
LLL are also known as machine level languages.

The Programing languages which are directly understandable to computer are known as LLL

MLL:
The Programing languages which consist of predefined code words which are understandable to computer through inyernideate code


HLL:
The language close to human language and easily understandable and instructible by programer to computer is known as High Level Language.
E.g:c++,Java,python,perl,Scala,ruby,php,kotlin,c#
 
==================================================================
About Java Language:

-Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language.

-It was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in 1995. It was initially called Green Talk and later renamed Java. The purpose of its creation was to develop a language suitable for embedded systems and to address the limitations of C and C++ languages.

-Java is popular for its features like platform independence (thanks to the Java Virtual Machine) and built-in support for multithreading.

-It is a statically typed and strongly coupled language.

-Its standardized support for exception handling makes it a robust language.

==================================================================
History  of java:
It was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in 1995. It was initially called Green Talk and later renamed Java. The purpose of its creation was to develop a language suitable for embedded systems and to address the limitations of C and C++ languages.

-It's first version was released in 1996
-in 2010 Java was owned by oracal
-stable version of java language was jdk 1.8 which was released in 2014
-Latest version is java 21 released in 2023
==================================================================
Platform:.
The combination of s/w and h/w component on which computer software runs is known as platform

Platform dependent softwares:
The softwares which run on only that type of platform on which they made I.e native type of platform are known as platform dependent softwares
E.g:software made using cand c++ 

Platform independent softwares:
The softwares which run on any  type of platform irrespective of platform on which they made  are known as platform independent softwares
E.g:software made using java 
==================================================================
Why s/w made using c and c++  are platform dependent and java are platform independent?
When we write code in c++,save with .cpp extension.Afyer successfully compilation of code native code is generated.Native code is the kanguage code which will execute only platform type on which they made.
Due to this s/w made using c and c++ are platform dependent

In contrast 
When we write code java save it with .java extention.After csuccessfull compilation of code will generate class file also known as byte code

This byte code is nighters understandable to programer as well as computer.
But this byte code can be converted into corresponding native machine code using JVM

JVM is Java Virtual Machine is a interpreter ,is a platform dependent s/w

Due to this java code cam run on any platform irrespective of platform on which it is made

Eventually this results in achieving platform independency

So .software made using java are platform dependent
==================================================================
Explain jdk architecture :

Jdk architecture consist of JDK ,JREand jvm

JDK:
JDk stands for 'Java Development Kit' is a package given oracal community.It is used to develop as well run java application.it internally consist of JRE and JVM
Technically we can define it as 
JRE along with development tool is termed as JDK.

JRE:
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It is used to run java applications .
It internally consist of JVM
Technically we can define it as ,
JVM along with built in Libraries termed as JRE

JVM
JVM stand for Java Virtual Machine .
It is an interpreter of java language which converts byte code which can be  generated by any platform  into corresponding platforms machine code ,which will lead to achive platform independency feature.

Summery
Jdk=JRE+Development tools(used to devlop an run java applications)
Jre=jvm+built in Libraries(used to run hava applications)
Jvm=java interpreter used to achive platform independency(used to convert byte code to corresponding platform's native machine code)

==================================================================
Explain structure of java language
-Package name
-import statements
-class block
 -method blocks
    -each method consist of set of instruction

Execution of class starts from main method, all other methods are directly or indirectly called by main method,and execution ends at main method

==================================================================
Tokens in java:
Tokens are the building blocks of programing language .They are smallest Unit of language used to build instructions

We several Tokens of java and they are
-keywords
-identifiers
-separator
-operator
-comment
-literals
________________________________________________________________________________
Keywords:keywords are reserve words.these are compiler aware words whoes meaning already known to compiler used to build instruction.
-Programer can't alter keywords
-Always in lowercase
-We can't use them as identifier
-java language has 51+ keywords (!!!)
-Eg::static,public,private,int,long,short,byte,float,for ,continue,break
________________________________________________________________________________
Identifiers:
Identifiers in java are nothing but names given to java members such as method,variable,interface and class
-we follow pascalse concention for class and interface Identifiers while for variable and method identifier we follow camalcase convention
-we have certain rules to for creating Identifiers and that are
  1)Identifiers should not start with digits
  2)Identifiers should not consist of special charecters except _ and $
  3)it should not consist of blank spaces
  4)keywords can't  be used as an identifier
________________________________________________________________________________
Separators in java:
Special charecters used to define and organise java program.they are used to separate block of related statement and defines the scope of variable,separate multiple variables,and Â±p0pacess java members
E.g:
{}
Will represent block of related statement

And the scope of variable declared inside block is limited to that block inly

E.g:braces,parenthesis,round bracket,square bracket,comma,semicolon,
________________________________________________________________________________
Operators :
These are special symbols which perform operations on operand (values) to get final result.
The final result is dependent on type of Porbandar used

For exaplme:Use of arithmetic operators will result interger or float value
Use of logical and comparison operator will result in boolean value

We have various type of operators in java 

Operation based operator
-Arithmetic operator
-Compound assignment operator
-Logical operator 
-Comparison operator 
-Bitwise operator


Operand based operator
-Unary
-Binary
-Ternery

.
Instances operator
New operator
________________________________________________________________________________
Comments:
-It is the information or note written by programer related to program inn order to understand program in better way.
-Comments are ignored during execution
-there are 2 types of comments
  -single line comment
  -multi line comments
      -official
      -unofficial
________________________________________________________________________________
Literals in java:
Literals are nothing but kinds of data we are going to deal while Programing in java.

In java Literals are of two types
A)primitive Literals
   Primitive Literals are the single value Literals. This Literals are further classified into 2 types
     A.a1)numerical primitive Literals 
             This Literals deal with number format values.Again this Literals are classified in two types and they are
              A.a1.a11)integer literals:numerical Literals without point values
              A.a1.a12)floating point  literals:numerical Literals with point values
     A.a2)non-numerical literals
             Charecter Literals, all charecters on keyboard are comes under chrecter Literals.Again this Literals is divided into 3 types and that types are
            A.a2.a21)Alphabets:these literal consist of English alphabets from a-z 
They are aging divided in to three types and that types are
                             A.a2.a21.1)uppercase charecter
                             A.a2.a21.1)lowercase charecter
             A.a2.a22) digits:there total 10 digits from 0-9
             A.a2.a23) special charecters:charecters other than digits and alphabets  
B)Non primitive literals
    These are multiple valued a Literals.
Different non-primitive Literals are
A)class
B)strings
C)array
D)interface
E)enum
==================================================================
Explain datatypes in java:
Datatypes  are the keyword which are used to declare variable and it specifies which kind of Literals it will be stored,
what will be its size and default value  .
E.g: byte a ;

Here byte is keyword and datatype which specifies declaring variable data type will of integer literal and it will store value within range -128 to 127


We have total 8 datypes in java and they are
byte :This datatype is of primitive integral type,stores 1 byte data .will store value from[ -2^-7 to 2^7 (-1)]

short This datatype is of primitive integral type,stores 2 byte data .will store value from[ -2^-15 to 2^15 (-1)]

int :This datatype is of primitive integral type,stores 4 byte data .will store value from[ -2^-31to 2^31 (-1)]

long :This datatype is of primitive integral type,stores 8 byte data .will store value from[ -2^-63 to 2^63 (-1)]

float :this datype will store floating point integral type with less number of presisions and of size 4 bytes.

double :float :this datype will store floating ppint integral type with more number of presisions and of size 8 bytes

char :the char dattype stores charecteral literal type value 0 to 2^16,and of size 2 byte
boolean:size can't determine as it depend on code.stores boolean literal type of value()
==================================================================
Variables in java:
Variables are the container which stores value and is created with the help of datatyes.
As java is statically typed language without specifying datypes of variable we can't declare variable.

Variable declaration is the proceass of declaring variable along with it's datatype
Syntax of variable declaration is ,
<datype-keword>  <variable-identifier>;

Variable initilisation the process of assigning value to declared variable
When we declare ad initilize variable simultaneously then we call it as variable declaration and initilisation

We can reassign value to declared variable an this process is known as reinitilization

We certain rules to naming variables and that are ,
1)variable name should not  start with number 
2) it should nt consist of special charecters other than $ and _
3)should not consist of blank spaces
4)keyword can't be used as an identifier

In java variables are mainly classifeied into two types and that are ,
A]Local variables 
B]Global variables

A]local varables :
Varables declared in any method block are known as local varable of that block and can't be acces out of that block .
I.e local variable's scope is limited to block only in which they are declared.

In have certain rules for declaring local variables and that are,
-we can't have multiple variable of same in same block 
-but can have multiple variable of same name in different blocks 
-scope of local variable  is limited to block in which  they are decclared
-we can't use local variable without initilisation .I.e before using variables in 
instruction the must be initilised with some value explicitly

B]Global varables :
Varibles declared in class block not in method block are known as global varables.
They can be accessed within class anywhere.

Global variables are further classified into two sub-types and taht are,
a]static variables 
b]non static variables 

a]static variables :
The global varables which are prefixed with 'static'  keyword (which work as non-access modifier) are known as static variables.
static variables are also known as class variables.


b]non-static variables :
The global varables which are not prefixed with 'static' keyword are known as non-satic variables.
Non-static variables are also known as 'Instance variables'.

Q1::Difference between local and global variables
Ans:
A]DECLARATION:
local varables are declared in method block while global variable declared in class block
B]ACCESSIBLITY OUT OF BLOCK:
local variables can't be accessed out side block block while global varables can be access 
outside block using class or object name as refrence.
c]ACCESSIBLITY OUT OF CLASS:
local variables can't be used in other class while global variable can be used in other class
D]DEFAULT VALUE:
Befotre uew initilisation of local variable is compulsory but in case of global variable 
it is not compulsory as they are initilised with default values implicitly if programer do not to initilise them.
