/*
 * 1. Introduction to Multithreading
 * - Explanation: Multithreading allows executing multiple threads simultaneously to 
 *   utilize CPU resources efficiently.
 * - Real-life Analogy: Multiple chefs in a kitchen preparing different dishes at the same time.
 * - Industry Application: Web servers handling multiple client requests concurrently.
 */

/*
 * 2. Creating Threads in Java
 * - Explanation: Threads can be created by extending the `Thread` class or implementing 
 *   the `Runnable` interface.
 * - Real-life Analogy: Extending `Thread` is like hiring a chef for one task, 
 *   while implementing `Runnable` allows flexibility for multiple roles.
 * - Industry Application: Runnable is often used for modular and flexible thread management.
 */

/*
 * 3. Thread Lifecycle
 * - Explanation: Threads transition through states like New, Runnable, Blocked, Waiting, 
 *   Timed Waiting, and Terminated.
 * - Real-life Analogy: A task going through different stages (e.g., planning, executing, paused).
 * - Industry Application: Debugging and performance optimization in multithreaded applications.
 */

/*
 * 4. Basic Thread Control
 * - Explanation: Use `start()` to begin a thread. `sleep()` pauses a thread, while `join()` 
 *   makes one thread wait for another to finish.
 * - Real-life Analogy: A chef taking a break (`sleep()`) or waiting for another chef to finish (`join()`).
 * - Industry Application: Sequencing tasks like rendering UI after background processes.
 */

/*
 * 5. Thread Safety and Synchronization
 * - Explanation: Thread safety ensures only one thread accesses shared resources at a time. 
 *   The `synchronized` keyword helps achieve this.
 * - Real-life Analogy: A bathroom with a single key that only one person can use at a time.
 * - Industry Application: Banking systems where data consistency is crucial.
 */

/*
 * 6. Inter-Thread Communication
 * - Explanation: `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()` enable threads to communicate and 
 *   coordinate execution.
 * - Real-life Analogy: Chefs waiting for ingredient delivery (`wait()`) and being notified 
 *   when it's available (`notify()`).
 * - Industry Application: Used in producer-consumer scenarios.
 */

/*
 * 7. Thread Priority
 * - Explanation: Threads can have priorities set from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). Higher-priority 
 *   threads are more likely to execute first but not guaranteed.
 * - Real-life Analogy: VIP customers getting priority service at a store.
 * - Industry Application: Real-time applications needing priority task management.
 */

/*
 * 8. Volatile Keyword
 * - Explanation: `volatile` ensures immediate visibility of changes to variables across threads.
 * - Real-life Analogy: Writing instructions on a whiteboard that everyone sees instantly.
 * - Industry Application: Used for flags in task completion checks.
 */

/*
 * 9. Thread Methods
 * - Explanation: `yield()` allows a thread to pause and let others execute. `isAlive()` checks 
 *   if a thread is still running.
 * - Real-life Analogy: A chef stepping back (`yield()`) to let others work; checking if anyone is 
 *   still cooking (`isAlive()`).
 * - Industry Application: `isAlive()` is useful for thread status checks during debugging.
 */

/*
 * 10. Handling Deadlocks
 * - Explanation: Deadlocks occur when threads wait for each other to release resources, halting progress. 
 *   Prevent them by consistent lock ordering or using timeouts.
 * - Real-life Analogy: Two drivers on a narrow road refusing to back up.
 * - Industry Application: Database and concurrent applications with resource locking.
 */

/*
 * 11. Basic Thread Pooling
 * - Explanation: Thread pools manage reusable threads, reducing the overhead of creating new threads. 
 *   Implemented using `ExecutorService`.
 * - Real-life Analogy: A set number of chefs handling orders in a restaurant instead of hiring new 
 *   chefs for every order.
 * - Industry Application: Web servers handling a fixed number of client requests efficiently.
 */

/*
 * 12. Best Practices for Multithreading
 * - Explanation: Minimize shared resource use to reduce synchronization overhead. Use thread-safe 
 *   collections and design immutable objects when possible.
 * - Real-life Analogy: Giving each chef their own tools to avoid resource sharing.
 * - Industry Application: Essential for scalable and responsive applications, such as real-time 
 *   trading platforms and gaming servers.
