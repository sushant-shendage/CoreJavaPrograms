-thread.sleep() is static method

-when thread is waiting or sleeping thread then and then only we can disturb thread
-by using interupt method we can disturb executing thread
-when thread is inturepted ,exception occured and catched in catch block
-it throws exception in presence of above states
  -it behaves as normal program in absence above mentioned states

-protottype is 'public void inturupt()'

-when we get illigal thread exception
-can we create our own exception?
  -using throw
  -difference between throw and throws

  Q::How and why intureup thread?
  Q::When it get inturupt?
     ans:when thread is in waiting or sleeping thread

  ***HOW CAN WWEE INTURUPT A THREAD***
  -To inturupt a thread java thread will class will provide inturupt method
  -inturupt method will help us to disturb the executing thread
  -it is anon-static method
  -prototype:'public void inturupt()'
  -If a thread are in waiting state are or sleeping state then only inturupt method will disturbs the thread
  -If a threads are not going in eigther in waiting statte or sleeping state then inturupt method will wait till 
   to thread will go to watinig state or sleeping state
  -If threads are not at all going to waiting state or sleeping state then there is no impact of inturupt method

 Questionns on string:
 01) String chararecters?
 02) why string are immutable?
 03) Why do we require OOPs concepts?
 04) what is object? Why we require object?
 05) What is constructor?
 06) What is constructor chaining?why we do constructor chaining?
     ANS:-
         -We do constructor chaining in order to avoid duplicate code in constructors
 07) what is Encapsulation?
 08) difference between arrayulisy and vector?


What is data inconsistency problem?
When multiple threads executing simulataniously on same java object 
there might be chances of data consistance .To avoid this problem we go for Synchronisation.

data consistency with analogy of biryani problem.
Solution:giving one person chance at a time
Solution:Executing one thread at a time insted of simulataniously

1)vectors are thread safe:One thread execute at time 
default size for vector=10  increses 100% in array list 50% increses
